# Alzheimer's Dataset logistic regression:
## By: Thomas Sogge

##  Description

This project asks the question, "What are the strongest predictors of Alzheimer's, and can we predict it effectively?". 
To solve this question, I chose a dataset from Kaggle with Alzheimer related data; I cleaned it, ran some descriptive analysis,
and completed both an OLS and Logistic regression to:
- (a) find the significant and strong variables for people getting Alzheimers,
- (b) Make a model which can predict the binary classification of sick/not sick

## How to run code

1. Start by downloading the .ipynb file
2. Download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/alzheimers-disease-dataset, or from the files.
3. Change the path and run the code.
